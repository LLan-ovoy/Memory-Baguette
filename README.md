# Yanan's Blogs - Memory Baguette

Data science and Machine Learning practice are exciting, as long as the corresponding knowledge can jump out immediately. But the truth is, the memory always sneaks away. 

When I was an undergraduate sophomore, I started using the avatar which I am using here.  It is from the episode of Memory Bread in Doraemon.

Back in those days, I was hoping that I can learn as much as possible and keep them in my head, just like after eating memory bread. However, the memory faded at an incredible speed. 

Now with a clear vision, I decided to write it down here and name it Memory Baguette. Doraemon's memory bread will lose efficacy after poopoo, while this time mine is not. XD

## Introduction

This is a collection of blogs about data science. Productization of a machine learning model requires a solid understanding of statistics, Linear Algebra, and programming techniques, at least knowing them to some degree.
